/**
 * Compute the full 32-bit kvno of a connection
 *
 * Given the 16-bit wire kvno and the local state, return the actual kvno which
 * should be used for key derivation. All values are in host byte order.
 * Understanding how we derive a 32-bit kvno from a 16-bit value requires some
 * explanation:
 *
 * After an rxgk conn is set up, our peer informs us of kvno changes by sending
 * the lowest 16 bits of its kvno. The real kvno being used is a 32-bit value,
 * but the peer cannot change the kvno arbitrarily; the protocol spec only
 * allows a peer to change the kvno by incrementing or decrementing it by 1. So
 * if we know the current 32-bit kvno ('local'), and we know the advertised
 * lower 16 bits of the new kvno ('wire'), we can calculate the new 32-bit kvno
 * ('*real').
 *
 * @param[in] wire	The 16-bit kvno from the received packet.
 * @param[in] local	The 32-bit kvno from the local connection state.
 * @param[out] real	The kvno to be used to process this packet.
